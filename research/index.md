# Research: Supramolecular Chemistry and Beyond

Molecular recognition lies at the heart of biology, underpinning everything from enzymatic catalysis to cell signaling. Our lab draws inspiration from these natural systems to create **molecular containers**—engineered supramolecular architectures with confined nanospaces that can selectively bind guest molecules with atomic precision.

These synthetic receptors enable a wide range of applications, from **catalysis** and **sensing** to **materials science** and **molecular medicine**. Ultimately, our work addresses pressing global challenges in **energy sustainability**, **environmental remediation**, and **human health**.

Grounded in molecular design and synthesis, our interdisciplinary research spans **supramolecular chemistry**, **organic synthesis**, **physical chemistry**, **polymer science**, and **functional materials**. We are especially intrigued by how noncovalent interactions—such as **hydrogen bonding**, **electrostatics**, and **hydrophobic effects**—can be orchestrated to build dynamic and functional molecular systems.

Group members receive cross-disciplinary training in chemistry, materials, and biology—preparing them for careers in **academia**, **industry**, **startups**, and **government labs**. We welcome curious, creative, and motivated individuals to join us in advancing the frontiers of molecular design.

## Hydrogen Bonding in Water

Hydrogen bonding is a cornerstone of biological recognition, but replicating its strength and selectivity in aqueous environments remains a major hurdle. In water, solvent molecules compete with receptor–guest interactions, often weakening binding.

To address this, we developed **dynamic covalent strategies** that pair imine formation with oxidation to yield stable macrocyclic and cage-like receptors. These structures are **highly modular**, allowing fine-tuning of **hydrophobic surfaces**, **electrostatics**, and **binding pocket geometry** for optimal function in water.

This approach reinvigorates hydrogen bonding as a viable interaction for aqueous molecular recognition, with potential applications in **drug delivery**, **biosensing**, and **environmental monitoring**.

## Synthetic Receptors for Biomolecules

The ability to selectively recognize biomolecules—such as **carbohydrates**, **lipids**, **peptides**, and **nucleotides**—is vital for understanding biological systems and developing medical diagnostics and therapeutics.

We design synthetic receptors that use **noncovalent complementarity** to differentiate between structurally similar biomolecules. Through thoughtful engineering of recognition motifs, we create systems that mimic biological specificity and function.

These platforms provide powerful tools for **biological exploration**, **disease detection**, and the development of **next-generation therapeutics**.

## Separation of Noble Metals, Critical Minerals, and High-Energy Materials

Critical materials—like **lithium**, **rare-earth elements**, and **platinum-group metals**—are vital to modern technologies, including **renewable energy**, **electronics**, and **defense systems**. As demand rises, **efficient and selective separation** from complex mixtures becomes increasingly important.

Our group designs synthetic ligands and receptors that target metal ions with high selectivity, even under **mild and sustainable conditions**. We integrate these into **porous solids**, **membranes**, and **solid supports** to create scalable, real-world separation technologies.

This research supports efforts in **resource recovery**, **clean energy**, and **green chemistry**, helping move toward a **sustainable circular economy**.
