# Research

Molecular recognition is ubiquitous in biology and plays a critical role in sustaining complex bioactivities. Synthetic molecular containers with confined nanospaces define receptor-substrate interactions in supramolecular systems and can be used to control catalysis, enable selective binding, and facilitate transport across membranes. Our lab is focused on developing new strategies to construct molecular containers that can recognize target substrates at atomic precision.

Our vision is to engineer supramolecular systems that offer transformative opportunities in **sensing, catalysis, critical mineral separation, environmental remediation, disease diagnosis, and precision therapy**. By integrating concepts from **supramolecular chemistry**, **organic synthesis**, **polymer chemistry**, and **materials science**, we aim to address pressing societal challenges in **energy**, **health**, and **environmental sustainability**.

Students in our group will receive **interdisciplinary training** at the interface of chemistry, materials science, and biology, preparing them for diverse careers in **academia, industry, national labs, and startups**. We welcome curious, creative, and motivated individuals to join us in pushing the boundaries of molecular design.

## Hydrogen Bonding in Water

Biological systems masterfully use **hydrogen bonding** to recognize molecules in water—a feat difficult to replicate with synthetic systems due to the overwhelming competition from water itself. Our lab tackles this challenge by employing **dynamic imine chemistry** coupled with **oxidation to amides**, creating novel receptor scaffolds that perform robustly in aqueous media.

Our design strategy allows us to tune **hydrophobicity**, **charge distribution**, and **spatial arrangement** of binding groups with high modularity. These receptors show strong and selective binding to substrates such as **oxalate**, **glucose**, and **nucleotides**, unlocking new frontiers in molecular mimicry and catalysis in water.

## Synthetic Receptors for Biomolecules

We design receptors to selectively bind **biologically relevant targets**, such as carbohydrates, peptides, and cofactors. By mimicking the **shape complementarity**, **electrostatics**, and **hydrogen-bonding networks** seen in natural receptors, we can create systems that enable **sensing**, **signal transduction**, or **inhibition of biochemical pathways**.

This line of research contributes to our understanding of **chemical recognition in living systems** and supports the development of diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies.

## Separation of Noble Metals, Critical Minerals, and Energetic Materials

We are pioneering **molecular recognition-based separation techniques** for **noble metals**, **critical minerals**, and **high-energy compounds**. These materials are essential for green energy technologies, electronics, and national security, yet their **selective separation and recycling** remain challenging.

Our synthetic receptors and polymers can distinguish minute structural or electronic differences between competing ions or molecules. This precision opens the door to **greener separations**, **urban mining**, and **waste stream valorization**.
