# Research: Supramolecular Chemistry and Beyond

Molecular recognition is a core process in biology, supporting everything from enzyme activity to cell communication. Our research aims to apply this biological precision to synthetic systems by creating molecular containers—supramolecular structures with confined nanospaces—that can selectively bind substrates with atomic accuracy. These artificial receptors could lead to breakthroughs in catalysis, sensing, materials science, and molecular medicine. Ultimately, our goal is to tackle global challenges in energy sustainability, environmental cleanup, and human health. Grounded in molecular design and synthesis, our work intersects with supramolecular chemistry, organic synthesis, physical chemistry, polymer chemistry, and advanced functional materials. We are especially interested in how noncovalent interactions—like hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic effects, and electrostatic forces—can be used to build complex molecular containers and dynamic systems. By examining these interactions, we learn how subtle structural features influence recognition and emergent properties in both natural and artificial environments. Students in our group will gain interdisciplinary training at the crossroads of chemistry, materials science, and biology, preparing them for careers in academia, industry, government labs, or startups. We invite curious, creative, and motivated individuals to join us in expanding the frontiers of molecular design.

## Hydrogen Bonding in Water

Hydrogen bonding is fundamental to molecular recognition in biological systems; however, replicating this selectivity and strength within aqueous environments continues to be a significant challenge for synthetic receptors. Water molecules readily interfere with noncovalent interactions, often outcompeting synthetic receptors for guest molecules. To address this obstacle, we have developed dynamic synthetic strategies that integrate imine formation with imine-to-amide oxidation, creating macrocycles and cages compatible with water. Our approach is modular and scalable, facilitating precise adjustments of hydrophobic domains, charge distributions, and binding pocket geometries. This methodology enables the revalidation of hydrogen bonding in water for the recognition of hydrophilic substrates. The implications of this research are extensive, spanning numerous applications, from drug delivery to environmental sensing.

## Synthetic Receptors for Biomolecules

Selective identification of biomolecules—such as carbohydrates, lipids, peptides, and nucleotides—is essential for comprehending biological mechanisms and advancing therapeutic technologies. Our laboratory designs synthetic receptors capable of distinguishing among structurally similar biomolecules through precisely tuned recognition motifs grounded in noncovalent complementarity. By employing strategies rooted in supramolecular chemistry, we have engineered receptors that function as molecular receptors for carbohydrates, lipids, and peptides. These platforms offer innovative tools for exploring biological recognition and hold potential for applications in disease diagnostics, biosensing, and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

## Separation of Noble Metals, Critical Minerals, and Energetic Materials

The global demand for critical raw materials—such as lithium, rare-earth elements, and platinum-group metals—continues to grow due to their essential roles in renewable energy, electronics, and defense technologies. Efficient and selective separation of these resources from complex mixtures is crucial for enabling a sustainable, circular economy. Our group develops synthetic receptors and ligands that exploit molecular recognition principles to achieve highly selective binding of metal ions and energetic anions under mild, environmentally friendly conditions. We further integrate these receptors into porous materials, polymeric membranes, and solid-state supports to realize practical, scalable separation platforms. Our research in this area contributes to energy security, resource recovery, and environmental remediation, aligning with global initiatives for sustainable materials management and green chemistry.
